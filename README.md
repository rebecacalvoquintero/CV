# Rebeca Calvo Quintero

Full-stack JavaScript developer at [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/), a fantastic agile software development bootcamp in London.

I consider myself a fast learner who works better when facing challenges. I care about writing testable and robust code as well as accessible websites and using technology for helping others.

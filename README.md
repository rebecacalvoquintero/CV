# Rebeca Calvo Quintero

Full-stack JavaScript developer at [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/), a fantastic agile software development bootcamp in London.

### About Me

I believe software development is as much about understanding people as understanding code and being able to empathise and communicate with others makes me a key team member who cares about delivering projects in an accurate manner.

From being open to new things and overcome challenges, I have not only been able to become familiar with the most popular technologies such as React, SQL or Node.js but also with the most niche ones such as Three.js or Cannon.js.

I believe you cannot write code without thinking about the people that wrote it or will be writing it after you.  For this reason, I endeavour to write readable and maintainable code.
